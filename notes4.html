HTML Document notes
You are able to let browsers aware of the fact that you are using HTML by starting up a Document Type Declaration.
The declaration looks like the following: <!DOCTYPE html>
The docuemnt type declaration must always be the first line of code in an HTML docuemnt. 
Even if its forgotten, the HTML document will still work though it's risky
After the Document Type Declaration add opening and closing (<html></html>) HTML tags.
You can add titles to your web page using the <title> element. 
Before we can add content closing body tags can be shown on the screen.
Once the file has a body, it can have different sort of things, like images, text, and buttons, which can be added to the body. 
"Self-closing elements" holds all the things that an intethat a browser will display, we have to add a body to the HTML file. 
The information inside the opening and rnet browser would use to render elementnts in a tag.
The line break element <br /> is one example of this. "<p>line one<br />line two</p>"
 When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element, and that one would play the role of a parent.
 HTML documents are a collection of parent and child document. 
  "<body>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
</body>"
  In the example above, the <p> element is the child to the <body> element. 
  Whitespace and indentation are two systems that programmers use to keep track of their of how elements are related, in their documents.
  The two of them use the independant position of elements to whitespace and indentation within an HTML file.
  I.E. <body><p>Paragraph 1</p><p>Paragraph 2</p></body> should actually look like the below: (with whitespace)
  <body>
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
</body>
WC3 or better known as the World Wide Web Consortium is a system responsible for maintaining the HTML quality.
In HTML, comments are written as follows: <!-- Insert Text Here --> 
In HTML, there are heading elements. In total, there are 6 of them and they have various functions such as giving titles to articles and pages.
I.E. : <h1> About Brown Bears </h1>
<p> is used to holf a piece of normal text.
<div> are used to divide HTML documents into multile sections.
<span>
<div> are used to divide HTML documents into multile sections.
The <em> and <strong> exist so that they can describe and organize the content that appears on your pages. 
<p><strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).</p>
The break element <br /> is meant for changing spacing.
