<DOCTYPE! hmtl>
HTML Document notes
You are able to let browsers aware of the fact that you are using HTML by starting up a Document Type Declaration.
The declaration looks like the following: <!DOCTYPE html>
The docuemnt type declaration must always be the first line of code in an HTML docuemnt. 
Even if its forgotten, the HTML document will still work though it's risky
After the Document Type Declaration add opening and closing (<html></html>) HTML tags.
You can add titles to your web page using the <title> element. 
Before we can add content closing body tags can be shown on the screen.
Once the file has a body, it can have different sort of things, like images, text, and buttons, which can be added to the body. 
"Self-closing elements" holds all the things that an intethat a browser will display, we have to add a body to the HTML file. 
The information inside the opening and rnet browser would use to render elementnts in a tag.
The line break element <br /> is one example of this. "<p>line one<br />line two</p>"
 When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element, and that one would play the role of a parent.
 HTML documents are a collection of parent and child document. 
  "<body>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
</body>"
  In the example above, the <p> element is the child to the <body> element. 
  Whitespace and indentation are two systems that programmers use to keep track of their of how elements are related, in their documents.
  The two of them use the independant position of elements to whitespace and indentation within an HTML file.
  I.E. <body><p>Paragraph 1</p><p>Paragraph 2</p></body> should actually look like the below: (with whitespace)
  <body>
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
</body>
WC3 or better known as the World Wide Web Consortium is a system responsible for maintaining the HTML quality.
In HTML, comments are written as follows: <!-- Insert Text Here --> 
In HTML, there are heading elements. In total, there are 6 of them and they have various functions such as giving titles to articles and pages.
I.E. : <h1> About Brown Bears </h1>
<p> is used to holf a piece of normal text.
<div> are used to divide HTML documents into multile sections.
<span>
<div> are used to divide HTML documents into multile sections.
The <em> and <strong> exist so that they can describe and organize the content that appears on your pages. 
<p><strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).</p>
The break element <br /> is meant for changing spacing.
Unordered list tag to create a list items in a randomized list with bullet points. 
individual items must be listed using <li> and it's used to list items. 
the <ul> tag cannot hold raw text so that is why we need the <li> 
<ol> are unordered lists and instead of bullet points, there are numbers. 
The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page.
The alt attritbute is solely used with the <img> element. It's value should be describing an image.
It helps with the visually impaired attribute. 
The video tag lets you add videos to the page and is very similar to the <img> tag.
It requires an opening and closing tag.
As a project grows in size, people may want to include extra folders within their main folders.
about.html, contact.html, and index.html are all different types of files. 
 If the files index.html is being displayed, then the other two will know that it's been open since their all in the same folder. 
 <nav> link is used to wrap links and organize them. 
   <h1> Tables </h1>
  In most websites, there are tables that are used to display information and this is the case because they are capable of presenting data and info very eficiently. 
 The <th> element allows one to to add titles to their rows.
 Using the colspan attribute, one can spread something across multiple columns. 
 The rowspan element is one that is used for information that spans mutiple rows in a graph. 
 The thead element is used to section off the headings.
 The tfoot element can be used to section off the bottom of a graph. 


 CSS
 CSS can alter and shape the way that an HTML element appears. 
 It can select elements with tag, class, or ID.
 Even though CSS and HTML are two completely different languages, CSS code can be written within HTML using inline codes. 
 HTML allows you ti type in CSS by using <style> commands.
 Creating a CSS file is simple. All you need is to vreate a file using .css.
 To link the two files together, you can create <link>
 The href element must be the adress, or path, to CSS file. 
 The type attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to. 
 The rel element desribes The relationship between the two files. The value should be set to style sheet.
The HTML tag for a paragraph is <p> and the syntax is p 
It is possible to select an element by its class attribute. An example would be the following: "<p class="brand">Sole Shoe Company</p>"
You can add multiple elemtns to an element's class.
An ID element needs an id attriute if you wiah to add it. 
The CSS can select an HTML element by their ID, by having CSS prepend the id name with a hashtag symbol.
CSS is capable fo selecting elements in HMTL via their class, ID or tag.
CSS classes are supposed to be recycled over a plethora of elements, so that you can change and alter elements in many different ways b mixing classes.
Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
Chaining Selectors... It is very much possible for an HTML element to have 2 CSS selectors. 
This is done by the combination of multiple selectors, and this is refered to as chaining. 
Nested Elements: CSS is able to select elements that are "nested" within other html elements. 
In CSS, there is one thing that is far more specific than IDs, which is the !important tag, which can be applied to specific attributes as opposed to an entire set of rules.
It should NEVER BE USED because it will override any style, no matter how specific it is. 
To prevent writting repetitive code, one can add multiple CSS styles to CSS selectors. 
Multiple differently selectors can have the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
The structure of CSS: To edit an HTML document using css, YOU MUST WRITE A CSS declaration inside of a CSS selector. 
A CSS delcaration consists of a value and a property... so what are they?
A property reffers to what you'd like to alter in an element, whther that be its size, or even colour.
A value reffers to the value of that property, meaning what colour, or what size or font will replace whatever was previously there. 
If you wiah to change the font or typeface, use the font-family property. 
Typeface and font-family aren't the only way to alter your texts. Did you know that you can alter the size using the font-size property. 
The font-weight property controls the depth of the text, which can make it bold.
