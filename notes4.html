HTML Document notes
You are able to let browsers aware of the fact that you are using HTML by starting up a Document Type Declaration.
The declaration looks like the following: <!DOCTYPE html>
The docuemnt type declaration must always be the first line of code in an HTML docuemnt.

  "<body>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
</body>"
  In the example above, the <p> element is the child to the <body> element. 
  Whitespace and indentation are two systems that programmers use to keep track of their of how elements are related, in their documents.
  The two of them use the independant position of elements to whitespace and indentation within an HTML file.
  I.E. <body><p>Paragraph 1</p><p>Paragraph 2</p></body> should actually look like the below: (with whitespace)
  <body>
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
</body>
