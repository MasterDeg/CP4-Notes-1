HTML Document notes
You are able to let browsers aware of the fact that you are using HTML by starting up a Document Type Declaration.
The declaration looks like the following: <!DOCTYPE html>
The docuemnt type declaration must always be the first line of code in an HTML docuemnt. 
Even if its forgotten, the HTML document will still work though it's risky
After the Document Type Declaration add opening and closing (<html></html>) HTML tags.
